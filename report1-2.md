## 4 AI Usage

- **Have you used AI to propose features for the project?**
  Yes, we have ask ChatGPT to provide advice of frontier tech stack in industry of web developing currently. One example of prompts we have used is

  ```
  I'm currently develop a web project based on SpringBoot and Vue 3.0. Provide me with some frontier framework or tech stack for brainstorm.
  ```

  The answer is long and here is a shortcut.

  ```
  Certainly! Here are some frontier frameworks and technologies that you might consider integrating into your Spring Boot and Vue 3.0 project:
  
  1. **GraphQL**: Instead of RESTful APIs, GraphQL provides a more efficient way to query and manipulate data. You can use libraries like Apollo Server for the backend and Apollo Client for the frontend.
  
  2. **Kotlin**: Kotlin is a modern programming language that runs on the JVM and is fully interoperable with Java. It can be used alongside Spring Boot to write concise and expressive code.
  
  ...
  
  Remember to assess the suitability of each technology based on your project requirements, team expertise, and long-term maintainability. Additionally, always prioritize learning and experimentation to stay updated with the latest advancements in web development.
  ```

- **Have you used AI to conduct the preliminary requirement analysis (e.g., identify functional and nonfunctional requirements)?**

  Yes, most of the requirement texts are first written by ChatGPT and then polished by us. The prompt is
  ```
